The sole purpose of this file is a learning excersize used to recreate common data structures.
Data structures are useful in learning algorithms and time analyses. The purpose is to create an 
understanding of these data structures and anything needed to build them.

Data Structures that I are included are:
String
Vector
Single Linked List
Double Linked List
Stack
